# two-generators-problem
ML solution for the problem of two random generators.

PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
There are two generators that generate points in a circle. We have 100 sets of 1000 points, every set was generated by one of these two generators. 
We should detect for each set, what generator was used.

GENERATORS CODE is in the solution.

SOLUTION REQUIREMENTS:
Correct prediction for at least 98% of sets.
Execution time up to 1 second.
